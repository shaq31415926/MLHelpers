# MLHelpers

This repo contains helper functions for experimenting with machine learning models in jupyter notebooks.

1. Features
>> Dummy variables

One hot encodes categorical variables.

>> Feature Selection

Class for performing feature selection for machine learning models or data preprocessing.

Implements four different methods to identify features for removal
        1. Identifies features with a missing percentage greater than a specified threshold
        2. Identifies features with a single unique value
        3. Identifies collinear variables with a correlation greater than a specified
        correlation coefficient
        4. Identifies features with the weakest relationship
        with the target variable

2. Machine Learning
